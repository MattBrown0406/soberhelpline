-- Ensure profiles table is not accessible to anonymous users
-- 1) Enforce RLS
ALTER TABLE public.profiles ENABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;

-- 2) Remove any existing policies that might apply to PUBLIC/anon
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Users can view their own profile" ON public.profiles;
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Users can insert their own profile" ON public.profiles;
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Users can update their own profile" ON public.profiles;

-- 3) Recreate owner-only policies, explicitly restricted to the authenticated role
CREATE POLICY "Users can view their own profile"
ON public.profiles
FOR SELECT
TO authenticated
USING (auth.uid() = id);

CREATE POLICY "Users can insert their own profile"
ON public.profiles
FOR INSERT
TO authenticated
WITH CHECK (auth.uid() = id);

CREATE POLICY "Users can update their own profile"
ON public.profiles
FOR UPDATE
TO authenticated
USING (auth.uid() = id)
WITH CHECK (auth.uid() = id);
